Description: 
        Moosic is a music player that focuses on easy playlist management. It consists
        of a server process that maintains a queue of music files to play and a client
        program which sends commands to the server. The server continually runs through
        its playlist, popping items off the top of the list and playing each with an
        external program. The client is a simple command-line utility which allows you
        to perform powerful operations upon the server's queue, including the addition
        of whole directory trees, automatic shuffling, and item removal according to
        regular expressions. The server comes configured to play MP3, Ogg, MIDI, MOD,
        and WAV files.
